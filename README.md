# AudicaCameraScript
 A mod for Audica that will load camera cues from a file to control the camera when in a song using MIDI ticks.

This mod is currently a WIP, may not work as intended.

Once you boot the game, it will create a folder in /Audica/Mods/Config/CameraScript where you can place files with name songid.json that contains camera cues.
